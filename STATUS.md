## Badge
We want to apply for **Functional, Reusable, Available** badges.

## Why
We make all the artifacts related to our work publicly accessible, including the AlloyMax executable, its source code, the benchmark problems, and the scripts to run the benchmark. Thus, we want to apply **Available** badge.

Also, we provide instructions to run AlloyMax and reproduce the results from our paper. Thus, we want to apply for **Functional** badge.

Finally, AlloyMax is a general purpose modeling tool. Researchers can use AlloyMax to solve any other problems that can be modeled in Alloy. Thus, we also want to apply for **Reusable** badge.
